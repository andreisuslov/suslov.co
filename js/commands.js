  `Cherry blossoms fall
Pink petals dance on the breeze
Spring who am I`,

  `Moonlight on water
Silver ripples cross the lake
Night who am I`,

  `Mountain peaks rise high
Clouds embrace their rocky crowns
Earth who am I`,

  `Autumn leaves crunch soft
Under my wandering feet
Path who am I`,

  `Starlight fills the sky
Ancient stories in the dark
Space who am I`,

  `Ocean waves crash loud
Salty spray upon my face
Sea who am I`,

  `Fireflies glow bright
Tiny lanterns in the grass
Light who am I`,

  `Snow covers the ground
Silence settles all around
White who am I`,

  `Sunflowers reach tall
Following the sun's journey
Growth who am I`,

  `Misty morning fog
Veils the world in secrecy
Haze who am I`,

  `River flows onward
Carving through rock and soil
Stream who am I`,

  `City lights twinkle
Concrete jungle never sleeps
Urban who am I`,

  `Desert sands stretch far
Endless dunes shift with the wind
Dust who am I`,

  `Forest stands silent
Ancient trees whisper secrets
Wood who am I`,

  `Raindrops on window
Patterns forming, flowing down
Storm who am I`,

  `Campfire embers glow
Stories shared under the stars
Flame who am I`,

  `Butterfly emerges
Wings unfurl in morning sun
Flight who am I`,

  `Thunder rolls distant
Lightning splits the darkened sky
Spark who am I`,

  `Sunrise paints the sky
New day brings fresh beginnings
Dawn who am I`,

  `Autumn leaf drifts down
Golden in the fading light
Time who am I`,

  `Mirror shows a face
Familiar yet strange to me
Truly who am I`,

  `Leaves fall seasons change
As years pass I transform too
Still who am I`,

  `In crowded spaces
Surrounded yet feeling lost
Quiet who am I`,

  `Memories fade fast
Present moments slip away
Seeking who am I`,

  `Dreams reveal secrets
Unconscious thoughts take new forms
Sleeping who am I`,

  `Roles I play each day
Son friend worker dreamer more
Core who am I`,

  `Nature's vastness calls
My place in it all unclear
Small who am I`,

  `Time marches onward
Past and future intertwine
Caught who am I`,

  `Choices shape my path
Each decision changes me
Shifting who am I`,

  `In life's ebb and flow
Constant amid the changes
Ever who am I`
